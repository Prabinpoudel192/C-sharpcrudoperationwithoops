Question: Student Management System
Create a console application in C# to manage student records. The program should demonstrate the use of get/set, CRUD operations, and polymorphism.
Requirements:
Define a base class Student:
Properties:
StudentID (int) (use get/set)
Name (string) (use get/set)
Age (int) (use get/set)
Method:
DisplayDetails(): Displays the student's details.
Define a derived class GraduateStudent:
Inherits from Student.
Additional Property:
Degree (string) (use get/set)
Override the DisplayDetails() method to include the Degree information.
CRUD Operations:
Implement the following functionalities in the main program:
AddStudent(Student student): Adds a new student (Student or GraduateStudent).
UpdateStudent(int studentID, string name, int age): Updates a student's basic details.
DeleteStudent(int studentID): Deletes a student by their StudentID.
GetStudent(int studentID): Retrieves a specific student's details.
ListStudents(): Displays all student records.
Main Program:

Create a menu-driven console application that allows the user to:
Add a Student or GraduateStudent.
Update a student's details.
Delete a student record.
View details of a specific student.
List all students.
Expected Output:
A simple console interface that allows CRUD operations on a list of students, demonstrating:

Encapsulation using get/set.
Polymorphism by overriding the DisplayDetails() method in the GraduateStudent class.
